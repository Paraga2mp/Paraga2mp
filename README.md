### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a programmer with a strong aptitude for learning new technologies 
and taking responsibilities. Iâ€™m graduating from NSCC in Apr 2021 with 
a major in IT Programming. Iâ€™ve completed a Bachelorâ€™s in computer science 
and an MBA before coming to Halifax, Canada as a permanent resident.

Despite my successful tenure in Business management, Iâ€™ve come to discover 
a passion for coding. During my course at NSCC, I became skilled in Java, 
C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, SQL Server, MariaDB. In addition, 
Iâ€™ve achieved a certification on OCA Java SE 8 Programmer.

Iâ€™m enthusiastic to develop a new career as a software developer.
